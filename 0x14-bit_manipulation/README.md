## BITWISE OPERATIONS IN C

This project deals with bitwise operators, their application and use cases in real life. A bitwise operation operates on a bit-string, a bit array or a binary numeral at the level of its individual bits.

Bitwise operators in C include:

1. NOT(~): It is a unary operation that performs logical negation on each bit i.e. it flips the bits that are 0 become 1 and viceversa.

2. AND(&): It is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations  and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits. If both bits compared in the compared position are 1, the result is 1, otherwise, the result is 0.

3. OR(|): It is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical inclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. If both bits compared are 0, the result is 0, otherwise the result is 1.

4. XOR(^): It is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length. The result in each position is 1 of only one of the bits is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1.

5. Left Shift Operator(<<): The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

6. Right Shift Operator(>>): The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
